## Background: MaST Program
The core patent portfolio (Patents 1–4) originates from Sandia National Laboratories' **Magnetic Smart Tags (MaST)** program for arms control and treaty verification. The technology uses electrochemical deposition (ECD) batch manufacturing to produce magnetoelastic resonator arrays capable of encoding millions of unique identification codes — requiring no battery power and immune to tampering. This IP foundation is being leveraged by VastVision for commercial and defense sensing applications.
